# fractal2D
Drawing program in processing involving recurtion and manipulation of PVectors.


The program draws fractals recursively using vector mathematics. It has three branches.
In each branch, the algorithm is modified to create a different fractal. In snowflake, I reproduced
a famous fractal. In the two others are of my invention. They are actually the same, but with
the vectors inverted.
